      <h3>With many major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics, physics, economics, computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.</h3>
      </p><p>Honors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The John von Neumann Theory Prize of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS, previously TIMS-ORSA) is awarded annually to an individual (or group) who have made fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.</li>
        <li>The IEEE John von Neumann Medal is awarded annually by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) "for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology.</li>
        <li>The John von Neumann Lecture is given annually at the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) by a researcher who has contributed to applied mathematics, and the chosen lecturer is also awarded a monetary prize.</li>
        <li>The crater von Neumann on the Moon is named after him.</li>
        <li>The John von Neumann Center in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey, was named in his honour.</li>
        <li>The professional society of Hungarian computer scientists, John von Neumann Computer Society, is named after John von Neumann.[183] It was closed in April 1989.</li>
        <li>On May 4, 2005 the United States Postal Service issued the American Scientists commemorative postage stamp series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations designed by artist Victor Stabin. The scientists depicted were von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Richard Feynman.</li>
        <li>The John von Neumann Award of the Rajk László College for Advanced Studies was named in his honour, and has been given every year since 1995 to professors who have made an outstanding contribution to the exact social sciences and through their work have strongly influenced the professional development and thinking of the members of the college</li>

      <h4>"It seems fair to say that if the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived," wrote Miklós Rédei in "Selected Letters."</h4>
